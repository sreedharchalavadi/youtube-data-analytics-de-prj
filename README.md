# Youtube data analytics ETL project

## Overview
This project was created to securely manage, streamline, and perform analysis on the structured and semi-structured YouTube videos data based on the video categories and the trending metrics.

## Project Goals
1. Data Ingestion — Build a mechanism to ingest data from different sources.
2. ETL System — We are getting data in raw format, transforming this data into the proper format.
3. Data lake — We will be getting data from multiple sources so we need centralized repo to store them.
4. Scalability — As the size of our data increases, we need to make sure our system scales with it.
5. Cloud — We can’t process vast amounts of data on our local computer so we need to use the cloud, in this case, we will use AWS.
6. Reporting — Build a dashboard to get answers to the question we asked earlier.
